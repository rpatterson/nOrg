# nOrg

Task outline organizing tool based on org-node

So far there are the beginnings of a well-tested JS library for manipulating a node tree
and a prototype UI built on [Web Components](https://open-wc.org).  The UX is very rough
at the moment and mostly just serves to verify model manipulations.

See the [demo](http://rpatterson.github.io/nOrg/src/nOrg-ng/) on
[github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles).

## Quickstart

To get started:

```sh
make run
```

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Karma
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
