Task outline organizing tool based on org-node

So far there are the beginnings of a well-tested JS library for
manipulating a node tree and a prototype UI built on
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).  The UX is very rough at the
moment and mostly just serves to verify model manipulations.

See the [demo](http://rpatterson.github.io/nOrg/src/nOrg-ng/) on
[github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles).
